With the rapid development of software and hardware, the application of artificial intelligence has recently become prominent and has been successfully and widely used in various fields.

However, the application of artificial intelligence in agriculture is quite limited. In addition to the long growth cycle of crops and the difficulty in accumulating large amounts of data, the labeling of agricultural data relies heavily on agricultural experts with professional knowledge, which can be used as a basis for machine learning. The training data set is severely insufficient.

This competition will download text data related to "Plant Epidemics" from the Open Data Platform of the Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan. It hopes to use artificial intelligence to annotate the results, establish a text recognition analysis module, and use the text data in the training set to perform relevant annotation and information extraction.
